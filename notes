Running the server in interactive mode:

$docker run -e "HOSTNAME=localhost" -e "CONTROL_PORT=9797" -e "PROXY_PORT=8888" -e "DEBUG=False" --net=host -it -v /{SOMEDIR}:/www goetz/nginx:0.1 bash

Upon container startup, then run
$./startup.sh

At this point:

	localhost:8888			Shows all static content
	localhost:8888/_ng		Endpoint for the nginx control API
	localhost:8888/ui		User Interface for nginx details


You can add more static UI content by pasting items into the SOMEDIR above
You can add more API content via curl:
	$curl -X POST -d '{"location": "/logging", "proxy": "http://localhost:4567"}' localhost:8888/_ng/endpoint
	
	"location" is the path for the api added to the nginx proxy (will be found at /api/{location})
	"proxy" is the proxy_pass nginx directive for the API location being added
